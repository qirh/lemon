  # apps/lemon_memory/mix.exs under the umbrella's mix.exs: it shares the
  # umbrella's build, deps and lockfile, and sibling packages resolve
  # in_umbrella. Anywhere else (deps/lemon_memory in a consumer, an unpacked
  # tarball) sibling packages resolve from hex. LEMON_HEX_PUBLISH=1 forces the
  # hex form inside the repo: `mix hex.build` records only hex dependencies and
  # refuses to build with an in_umbrella one.
